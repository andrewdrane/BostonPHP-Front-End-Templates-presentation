[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)
=================

Bootstrap provides simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. In other words, it's a front-end toolkit for faster, more beautiful web development. It's created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.

To get started, checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!



Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:twitter/bootstrap.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master).



SASS: Usage
-----------

You can use the SASS Twitter Bootstrap by dropping the compiled CSS into any new project and start cranking.

Because SASS always outputs standard css, just link to the final output like normal:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap-2.0.4.css">`

For more info, refer to the docs!



SASS: Basic modification
------------------------

You can learn more about SASS at:

[sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com)

SASS runs as a local GEM on your system. You can run `sass --watch lib/bootstrap.scss:bootstrap-2.0.4.css`



Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.

SASS: Developers
----------------

We have included a Rakefile with convenience methods for working with the SASS Bootstrap library.

+ **build** - `rake build`
This will run the less compiler on the bootstrap lib and regenerate the docs dir.
The lessc compiler is required for this command to run.

+ **watch** - `rake watch`
This is a convenience method for watching your Sass files and automatically building them whenever you save.



Developers
----------

We have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.

+ **dependencies**
Our makefile depends on you having recess, uglify.js, and jshint installed. To install, just run the following command in npm:

```
$ npm install recess uglify-js jshint -g
```

+ **build** - `make`
Runs the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs pages. Requires recess and uglify-js. <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#compiling">Read more in our docs &raquo;</a>

+ **test** - `make test`
Runs jshint and qunit tests headlessly in phantom js (used for ci). Depends on having phatomjs installed.

+ **watch** - `make watch`
This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.


Contributing
------------

Please make all pull requests against wip-* branches. Also, if your unit test contains javascript patches or features - you must include relevant unit tests. Thanks!

Sass Conversion Quick Tips
--------------------------

* replace @ with $
* replace . with @include for mixins
* replace `spin` with `adjust-hue`
* add !default to variable definitions
* replace #gradient > .vertical with @include gradient-vertical
* replace #grid > .style with @include grid-style
* use grid-core and grid-fluid mixins instead of #grid > .core and #grid > .fluid
* use font-shorthand instead of #font > .shorthand
* replace fadein with fade-in
* move @import for reset below mixins, because it uses tab-focus mixin in bootstrap.scss
* explicitly provide .clearfix, .hide-text and .input-block-level for compatibility with LESS output
* pass grid-* mixin arguments to generators, because otherwise the generator mixins will use the default variables pull transition definition into variable
